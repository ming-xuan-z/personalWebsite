I have a technical background and passion for parallel computing, distributed systems, and data science. I'm an incoming
software engineer intern at [Bodo](https://www.bodo.ai), and I will be TAing 15-210,
Parallel and Sequential Data Structure and Algorithms at CMU for spring 2022.

Previously, I spent my first year of college at [Wesleyan University](https://www.wesleyan.edu), where I 
studied political science, economics, and mathematics.
